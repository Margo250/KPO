A computer operates through the synergy of hardware and software. 
Hardware is the computer's physical electronic and mechanical parts. 
Software consists of the programs that instruct the hardware to perform tasks. 
The core hardware includes a central processing unit (CPU), input, memory-storage, 
and output devices, interconnected by a bus system typically integrated into the motherboard.
